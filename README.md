Grab prices from pharmacies in Porto Alegre

This is a custom code to grab prices from Panvel, DrogaRaia and Pague Menos pharmacies in Brazil.
You can specify the product pages, and it will automatically grab the price and even compare unit price between different 
product quantities.

Example: 
20 pills with a price of BRL 70, costs 3.5 BRL for each pill
40 pills with a price of BRL 130, costs 3.25 BRL for each pill

I have created one file per each remedy. No global files have been created yet.
